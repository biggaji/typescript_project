// Narrowing
// Narrowing is the process of refining types to a more specific type than the declared one.
// within our conditional check, e.g. if check "typeof padding === "number", typescript sees and understand that as a special type of code call type guards.
// In TypeScript, checking against the value returned by typeof is a type guard.
